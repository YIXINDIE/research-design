<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sivarajan</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate beginner eager to dive into the world of Data Science..</h3>

- ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a Test Engineer with over six years of experience working in the Plastic Manufacturing industry near Senai, Johor.

   - I hold a Bachelor's degree in Petroleum Engineering, and though I initially entered the field due to the oil and gas industry's downturn during my graduating year.  

   - Iâ€™ve since built a solid career in manufacturing, where I've gained valuable insights into testing and quality control.  

   -  However, after six years in the plastic manufacturing industry, I began to feel the need for new challenges. 

   -    As I explored career paths with strong growth prospects, I discovered the field of Data Science â€“ a field that aligns perfectly with my analytical skills and my passion for problem-solving. 

   -    This has led me to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Data Science to transition into this exciting and dynamic domain.  

   -  While I donâ€™t have coding experience yet, I am committed to learning and honing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and programming.

   -  I'm excited to leverage my background in problem-solving and analysis to thrive in the data science field.

- Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories as I embark on this learning journey. Iâ€™m eager to contribute to projects and collaborate with others in the data science community.
